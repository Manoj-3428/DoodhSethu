# Fat Table Implementation

## Overview

The fat table functionality has been completely rewritten from scratch to provide a robust, local-first storage system with background Firestore synchronization. The implementation ensures no user lag while maintaining data consistency across devices.

## Key Features

### 1. Local-First Storage
- All fat table operations are performed on local storage first
- UI updates immediately without waiting for network operations
- Data is always available even when offline

### 2. Background Firestore Sync
- Changes are synced to Firestore in the background when online
- No blocking operations that could cause UI lag
- Automatic retry mechanism for failed syncs

### 3. Strict Validation Rules
- No overlapping fat ranges allowed
- Validation occurs both during addition and editing
- Clear error messages for validation failures

### 4. Ascending Order Display
- Fat table entries are always displayed in ascending order by "from" value
- Consistent sorting across all screens

## Architecture

### Components

1. **FatTableViewModel** - Main business logic and state management
2. **FatTableRepository** - Data access layer with local and remote operations
3. **FatTableDao** - Local database operations
4. **FatTableUtils** - Utility functions for fat table operations
5. **FatTableScreenNew** - UI for managing fat table entries

### Data Flow

```
User Action → ViewModel → Repository → Local Storage → Background Firestore Sync
```

## Implementation Details

### FatTableViewModel

The ViewModel provides the following key methods:

- `initializeData(isOnline: Boolean)` - Load data from local storage, sync with Firestore if online
- `addFatRow(row: FatRangeRow, isOnline: Boolean)` - Add new fat range with validation
- `updateFatRow(row: FatRangeRow, isOnline: Boolean)` - Update existing fat range with validation
- `deleteFatRow(row: FatRangeRow, isOnline: Boolean)` - Delete fat range
- `getPriceForFat(fatPercentage: Double)` - Get price for a given fat percentage
- `refreshData(isOnline: Boolean)` - Manual sync with Firestore

### FatTableRepository

The Repository handles:

- Local database operations (CRUD)
- Firestore synchronization
- Validation logic
- Background sync operations

### FatTableUtils

Utility functions for:

- `getPriceForFat(fatPercentage: Double, fatRanges: List<FatRangeRow>)` - Calculate price for fat percentage
- `validateFatRange(newRow: FatRangeRow, existingRows: List<FatRangeRow>, excludeId: Int?)` - Validate no overlaps
- `sortFatRanges(fatRanges: List<FatRangeRow>)` - Sort ranges by from value

## Usage in Other Screens

### DailyMilkCollectionScreen

The DailyMilkCollectionScreen now automatically calculates prices based on fat percentage:

```kotlin
// Auto-calculate price when fat percentage changes
LaunchedEffect(fatPercentage) {
    val fatValue = fatPercentage.toDoubleOrNull()
    if (fatValue != null && fatValue > 0) {
        val calculatedPrice = FatTableUtils.getPriceForFat(fatValue, fatTableRows)
        if (calculatedPrice > 0) {
            price = calculatedPrice.toString()
        }
    }
}
```

### AddMilkCollectionScreen

The AddMilkCollectionScreen uses the utility function for price calculation:

```kotlin
val pricePerLiter = if (fatValue != null && fatTableRows.isNotEmpty()) {
    FatTableUtils.getPriceForFat(fatValue, fatTableRows)
} else 0.0
```

## Validation Rules

1. **No Overlapping Ranges**: When adding or editing a fat range, it must not overlap with any existing ranges
2. **Valid Range Values**: The "from" value must be less than the "to" value
3. **Edit Exclusion**: When editing a range, the current range is excluded from overlap validation

## Firestore Collection

- **Collection Name**: `fat_table` (unchanged as requested)
- **Document Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "from": 3.0,
    "to": 4.0,
    "price": 50.0
  }
  ```

## Error Handling

- Local operations always succeed (data is saved locally)
- Firestore operations are performed in background
- Failed syncs are logged but don't affect user experience
- Clear error messages for validation failures

## Testing

Unit tests are provided in `FatTableUtilsTest.kt` to verify:
- Price calculation for different fat percentages
- Validation of overlapping ranges
- Sorting functionality
- Edit validation (excluding current row)

## Migration Notes

- Existing fat table data will be preserved
- The collection name remains `fat_table` as requested
- No changes required to existing code that uses fat table data
- New utility functions are available for easier integration

## Performance Considerations

- All operations are performed on background threads
- UI updates are immediate and non-blocking
- Firestore operations are batched and optimized
- Local storage provides instant access to data
